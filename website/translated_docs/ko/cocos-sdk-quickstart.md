Loom Cocos SDK 구조 다이어그램

![](/developers/img/loom-cocos-sdk-struct.png)

`Loom-Cocos-SDK`은 `loom-js`와 동일한 api, 동일한 protobuf, 비스한 컨트랙트를 가지고 있습니다.

`Loom Cocos SDK` is base on [Loom-JS](https://github.com/loomnetwork/loom-js/) , and proting it to `Cocos Creator` .

### Generate LoomJS SDK

- `git clone https://github.com/loomnetwork/cocos-sdk.git`
- `cd cocos-sdk`
- `git submodule update --init`, update git submodule
- `./tools/genCocoSDK.py`

`Loom SDK for Cocos Creator` is the directory `loom-cocos-sdk`, which is generated by command `./tools/genCocoSDK.py`

## Install Loom

    wget https://private.delegatecall.com/loom/osx/build-404/loom
    chmod +x loom
    
    mkdir tmpgopath
    export GOPATH=`pwd`/tmpgopath
    ./loom spin weave-blueprint
    cd blueprint
    export GOPATH=$GOPATH:`pwd`
    make deps
    make
    cd build
    
    ../../loom init
    cp ../genesis.example.json genesis.json
    

Run Blockchain:

    # unable to start http server: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:9092: bind: address already in use
    pkill blueprint # kill server first
    ../../loom run
    

Please consult the [Loom SDK docs](https://loomx.io/developers/docs/en/prereqs.html) for further instruction on running your own DappChain.

## Install Cocos Creator

![](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/s/images/creator_192.png)

Cocos Creator is a complete package of game development tools and workflow, including a game engine (based on Cocos2d-x), resource management, scene editing, game preview, debug and publish one project to multiple platforms.

For the first time we introduced entity-component structure and data-driven workflow to the Cocos2d-x family. With JavaScript, you can scripting your component in no time. The editor and engine extension is also made with JavaScript so you can make games and refine your tool in a single programming language.

Cocos Creator provides an innovative, easy to use toolset such as the UI system and Animation editor. The toolset will be expanding continuously and quickly, thanks to the open editor extension system.

you can download `Cocos Creator` from [here](http://www.cocos.com/creator) , and install.

## Integrate to Creator Game

1. copy the generated `Loom Cocos SDK` to your project's `asset/script` directory, and rename it to `loom`
2. write your own `proto` file as requirements of your game e.g. `sample/loomDemoForCreator` use [setscore.proto](https://github.com/loomnetwork/phaser-sdk-demo/blob/master/src/assets/protobuff/setscore.proto), and related [setscore_pb.js](https://github.com/loomnetwork/phaser-sdk-demo/blob/master/src/assets/protobuff/setscore_pb.js)
3. write yur own contract as requirements of your game, and serailezse your data with `setscore_pb.js`, and send to Loom Blockchain, take a look at [SimpleContract](https://github.com/loomnetwork/phaser-sdk-demo/blob/master/src/SimpleContract.js)

1. invoke api of your contract at suitable position.
2. Run

## Sample:

There are two `Sample` projects:

- `loomDemoForCreator` simplely use loom sdk
- `dark-slash` use loom sdk in a real game

Test Steps

- update git submodule, run command `git submodule update --init`, if you have done this, skip this.
- generate and pack `Loom Cocos SDK`, run command `./tools/genCocoSDK.py`
- sync `Loom Cocos SDK` to `sample/loomDemoForCreator` and `sample/dark-slash`, run command `./tools/syncLoomJSToSample.py`
- entry directory `blueprint/build`, run `Loom Block Chain` services, run command `../../loom run`, if you have done this, skip this.
- open `sample/loomDemoForCreator` or `sample/dark-slash` with `Cocos Creator` and run

## Notice

- `Loom Block Chain` configuration, Contract's usage, take a look at [this](https://loomx.io/developers/docs/en/prereqs.html)
- Sample `dark-slash` come from `Cocos Creator` [Tutorial Project](https://github.com/cocos-creator/tutorial-dark-slash)
