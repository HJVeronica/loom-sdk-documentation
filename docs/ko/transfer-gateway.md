## 개요

Transfer 게이트웨이는 Loom DAppChain과 이더리움 네트워크간에 토큰 전송을 가능하게 해줍니다. 현재는 오직 ERC721 토큰만 지원합니다만, ERC20 토큰과 ETH도 차후 지원될 예정입니다.

Transfer 게이트웨이는 4가지 주요 컴포넌트로 구성되어 있습니다:

- 이더리움 위에 올라간 게이트웨이 Solidity 컨트랙트 (메인넷 게이트웨이)
- Loom DAppChain 위에 올라간 게이트웨이 Go 컨트랙트 (DAppChain 게이트웨이)
- Loom DAppChain 위에 올라간 어드레스 Mapper Go 컨트랙트
- 게이트웨이 Oracle (DAppChain 노드 위에서 실행되는 프로세스 혹은 독립적인 프로세스로 동작될 수 있음)

When a user wishes to transfer a token from their Ethereum account to their DAppChain account they must first transfer it to the Mainnet Gateway, which in turns emits a deposit event. The deposit event is picked up by the Gateway Oracle which forwards it onto the DAppChain Gateway. The DAppChain Gateway then transfers the token to the DAppChain account of the user that deposited the token into the Mainnet Gateway.

To get that same token back into their Ethereum account the user must first transfer the token back to the DAppChain Gateway, which creates a pending withdrawal. The pending withdrawal is picked up by the Gateway Oracle, which signs the withdrawal, and notifies the DAppChain Gateway. The DAppChain Gateway emits an event to let the user know they can withdraw their token from the Mainnet Gateway to their Ethereum account by providing the signed withdrawal record.

## ERC721 컨트랙트 설정하기

To transfer an ERC721 token from Ethereum to the DAppChain you'll need two of your own ERC721 contracts, one on Ethereum (Mainnet ERC721), and the other on the DAppChain (DAppChain ERC721).

Your Mainnet ERC721 contract doesn't need anything special to work with the Transfer Gateway. Though you might want to add something like the `depositToGateway` method below to make it a bit easier to transfer tokens into the Mainnet Gateway:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

import "openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Token.sol";

contract MyAwesomeToken is ERC721Token("MyAwesomeToken", "MAT") {
    // 메인넷 게이트웨이 주소
    address public gateway;

    constructor(address _gateway) public {
        gateway = _gateway;
    }

    function depositToGateway(uint tokenId) public {
        safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, gateway, tokenId);
    }

}
```

Your DAppChain ERC721 contract must provide a public `mintToGateway` method to allow the DAppChain Gateway to mint tokens that are transferred from Ethereum:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.4.24;

import "openzeppelin-solidity/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Token.sol";

/**
 * @title Loom DAppChain을 위한 완전한 ERC721 토큰
 * 구현은 모든 ERC721 표준의 모든 요구사항과 추가적인 기능을 포함합니다
 * 또한, Loom DAppChain 호환성을 위해 요구되는 몇가지 기능도 포함합니다.
 */
contract MyAwesomeToken is ERC721Token {
    // DAppChain Gateway address
    address public gateway;

    constructor(address _gateway) ERC721Token("MyAwesomeToken", "MAT") public {
        gateway = _gateway;
    }

    // Used by the DAppChain Gateway to mint tokens that have been deposited to the Mainnet Gateway
    function mintToGateway(uint256 _uid) public
    {
        require(msg.sender == gateway);
        _mint(gateway, _uid);
    }
}
```

> The DAppChain Gateway will only attempt to mint tokens it doesn't already own, so if you'd rather manage the token supply yourself you can pre-mint them to the DAppChain Gateway instead of implementing the `mintToGateway` function.

When you're happy with your contracts you can deploy them with Truffle to Ethereum and the DAppChain, you may want to take a look at [loom-truffle-doc](web3js-loom-provider-truffle.html).

## 메인넷 컨트랙트와 DAppChain 컨트랙트 매핑하기

Once you've deployed your contracts you'll need to send a request to the DAppChain Gateway to create a mapping between them. When the DAppChain Gateway is notified that a token from your Mainnet ERC721 contract has been deposited to the Mainnet Gateway it will mint a matching token in your DAppChain ERC721 contract (unless the token already exists on the DAppChain). The DAppChain Gateway will refuse to create a contract mapping unless you provide proof that you deployed both contracts.

To prove that you deployed the Mainnet ERC721 contract you must provide a signature generated by signing a message using the Ethereum private key you used to deploy the contract, and a hash of the Mainnet transaction that deployed the contract.

To prove that you deployed the DAppChain ERC721 contract you simply need to sign the request sent to the DAppChain Gateway using the DAppChain private key you used to deploy the contract, the DAppChain Gateway will verify that the sender of the request deployed the contract by looking up the contract creator in the DAppChain contract registry.

After a contract mapping request is received by the DAppChain Gateway there will be a small delay before it is picked up by the Gateway Oracle. The Gateway Oracle will lookup the transaction that deployed the Mainnet contract to find out who really deployed it, and will then submit its findings back to the DAppChain Gateway, which will either approve the requested mapping, or simply throw it out.

## DAppChain으로 ERC721 토큰 전송하기

Alice has managed to acquire one of your awesome tokens on Mainnet and now wants to transfer it to her DAppChain account. Before she can do so she must send a request to the Address Mapper contract to create a mapping between her Ethereum and DAppChain accounts. Like the DAppChain Gateway the Address Mapper will refuse to create an account mapping unless Alice provides proof that she is the owner of both accounts.

To prove that she owns her Mainnet account Alice must provide a signature generated by signing a message using the Ethereum private key associated with the account. And to prove she owns her DAppChain account she just needs to sign the request she sends to the DAppChain Gateway using the DAppChain private key associated with her account. As soon as the Address Mapper receives the request it will create the requested account mapping, and Alice can start transferring tokens between her Ethereum and DAppChain accounts.

## 이더리움으로 ERC721 token 전송하기

Alice has had her fun on the DAppChain so she wants to transfer her token from her DAppChain account back to her Mainnet account. First she must grant approval to the DAppChain Gateway to take over ownership of the token she wants to transfer, she can do this by sending a request to the DAppChain ERC721 contract.

Next, Alice should send a request to the DAppChain Gateway to start the token withdrawal process. When the DAppChain Gateway receives the request it creates a pending withdrawal record for Alice, and then waits for the Gateway Oracle to sign the pending withdrawal. After a small delay the Gateway Oracle signs the pending withdrawal, and submits the signature to the DAppChain Gateway, which in turn emits an event to notify Alice that her pending withdrawal has been signed.

To complete the withdrawal process Alice must provide the withdrawal signature (generated by the Gateway Oracle) to the Mainnet Gateway, which then transfers the corresponding token to Alice's Mainnet account.

## 요약

You should now have a basic understanding of how the Transfer Gateway works, though we haven't presented nor explained any of the actual API yet. If you haven't already, take a look at the [Transfer Gateway Example](https://github.com/loomnetwork/transfer-gateway-example) project, which was built using the Transfer Gateway API provided by [loom-js](https://github.com/loomnetwork/loom-js).
