`Loom-Cocos-SDK` have the same API, same protobuf, similar contract with `loom-js`.

`Loom Cocos SDK` is based on [Loom-JS](https://github.com/loomnetwork/loom-js/), and porting it to `Cocos Creator`.

### Generate Cocos SDK
* `git clone https://github.com/loomnetwork/cocos-sdk.git`
* `cd cocos-sdk`
* `git submodule update --init`, update git submodule
* `./tools/genCocoSDK.py`

`Loom SDK for Cocos Creator` can be found in the directory `loom-cocos-sdk`, which is generated by running `./tools/genCocoSDK.py`

## Install Loom

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/loomnetwork/loom-sdk-documentation/master/scripts/get_loom.sh | sh
```

```bash
mkdir tmpgopath
export GOPATH=`pwd`/tmpgopath
./loom spin weave-blueprint
cd blueprint
export GOPATH=$GOPATH:`pwd`
make deps
make
cd build

../../loom init
cp ../genesis.example.json genesis.json
```

Run the blockchain:

```
# unable to start http server: listen tcp 127.0.0.1:9092: bind: address already in use
pkill blueprint # kill server first
../../loom run
```

Please consult the [Loom SDK docs](https://loomx.io/developers/en/prereqs.html) for further instruction on running your own DappChain.

## Install Cocos Creator

![](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/s/images/creator_192.png)

Cocos Creator is a complete package of game development tools and workflow, including a game engine (based on Cocos2d-x), resource management, scene editing, game preview, debug and publish one project to multiple platforms.

For the first time, we introduced the entity-component structure and data-driven workflow to the Cocos2d-x family. With JavaScript, you can script your component in no time. The editor and engine extension is also made with JavaScript so you can make games and refine your tool in a single programming language.

Cocos Creator provides a few innovative, easy to use toolsets such as the UI system and Animation editor. The toolset will be expanding continuously and quickly, thanks to the open editor extension system.

You can download `Cocos Creator` from [here](http://www.cocos.com/creator). Next, go ahead and install it.

## Integrate to Creator Game

1. copy the generated `Loom Cocos SDK` to your project's `asset/script` directory, and rename it to `loom`
2. write your own `proto` file as requirements of your game
  e.g. `sample/loomDemoForCreator` use  [setscore.proto](https://github.com/loomnetwork/phaser-sdk-demo/blob/master/src/assets/protobuff/setscore.proto), and related [setscore_pb.js](https://github.com/loomnetwork/phaser-sdk-demo/blob/master/src/assets/protobuff/setscore_pb.js)
3. write your own contract as requirements of your game and serialize your data with `setscore_pb.js`. Next, send to Loom Blockchain. For details, take a look at the [SimpleContract](https://github.com/loomnetwork/phaser-sdk-demo/blob/master/src/SimpleContract.js)

4. invoke the API of your contract at a suitable position.
5. Run

## Sample:

There are two `Sample` projects:
* `loomDemoForCreator`- a simple use case of the Loom SDK.
* `dark-slash`- uses the  Loom SDK in a real game.

**Test Steps**

* Update git submodule by running `git submodule update --init`. If you have done it, just skip this step.
* Generate and pack `Loom Cocos SDK`, by running `./tools/genCocoSDK.py`
* Sync `Loom Cocos SDK` to `sample/loomDemoForCreator` and `sample/dark-slash`. Just run the following command: `./tools/syncLoomJSToSample.py`
* `cd` into the `blueprint/build` directory and run the `Loom Block Chain` services- `../../loom run`. If Loom is already running on your machine, feel free to skip this step.
* Open `sample/loomDemoForCreator` or `sample/dark-slash` with `Cocos Creator` and run

## Notice

* For more details on `Loom Block Chain` configuration, Contract's usage, take a look at [this](https://loomx.io/developers/en/prereqs.html)
* Sample `dark-slash` come from `Cocos Creator` [Tutorial Project](https://github.com/cocos-creator/tutorial-dark-slash)
