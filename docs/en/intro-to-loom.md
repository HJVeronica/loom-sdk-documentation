![What is Loom Network?](/developers/img/what-is-loom.png)

Loom Network is building a fundamental infrastructure platform to help Ethereum scale. It allows developers to run large-scale applications and is the first Ethereum scaling solution to be live in production.

In short, you can think of Loom Network as EOS on top of Ethereum.

For advanced teams that need a custom blockchain, the Loom SDK will also let you [spin up](basic-install-all.html) your own DPoS chain in just a few minutes.

## What is PlasmaChain?

PlasmaChain will be the central hub that all these chains connect to as their bridge to Ethereum, for interchain communication with other major blockchains (such as Cosmos, EOS, and Tron), and as a shared liquidity pool for tokenized assets.

Thus, our company’s primary objectives over the next year are all related to growing PlasmaChain to become the “universal Layer 2” for high performance dapps.

In the next chapter, you will learn how to deploy your first app to Loom PlasmaChain. Let's get started!
