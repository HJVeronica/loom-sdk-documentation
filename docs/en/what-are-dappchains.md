## DAppChains: Each DApp on its Own Sidechain

The Loom SDK generates what’s called a DAppChain — a Layer 2 blockchain that uses Ethereum as its base layer.

Running each DApp on its own sidechain to Ethereum has a number of benefits, but most importantly- DAppChains can use alternative consensus rulesets (like DPoS) that optimize for high scalability.

Using Ethereum as a base layer means DAppChain-based assets (like ERC20 and ERC721 tokens) can have the security guarantees of Ethereum, especially when backed by Plasma.

To learn how to deploy your first application, check our [Truffle DAppChain Example](https://github.com/loomnetwork/truffle-dappchain-example) repo.
